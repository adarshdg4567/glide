# Glide FPV Build Log  
**total time: 50+ hours of sanding, sketching, and semi-controlled chaos**  
this is me, a 16-year-old, trying to build an fpv plane from scratch. it‚Äôs called glide because it sounds cool and that‚Äôs what i hope it‚Äôll do.

## June 1 - so i decided to build a plane  
honestly it just started as a random idea. thought it‚Äôd be fun to make something that flies. sketched a basic layout on paper, went through my old foam models for inspo. made a folder and named it glide because why not.  
**Time Spent: 2 hrs**

## June 2 - fuselage got my brain fried  
started designing the fuselage in fusion 360. messed up some offsets and the whole body came out looking like a brick. tried segmenting it into 5 parts so it‚Äôs printable. finally got it looking sleek-ish.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**

---

## June 4 - wingspan dreams  
looked at how long wings should be. 900mm? 1200mm? went with something chill and started designing left wing parts. tried aileron cuts too. trimmed some curves so they look airfoil-ish.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**  
<!-- Use: Wing L 1.step -->

---

## June 5 - tail tales  
opened a new file and tried out tail design. decided on a V-tail originally, changed it after realizing it needs more coding. made stab 1 and rudder layout. basic but clean.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**

---

## June 7 - locking stuff in place  
i was having issues with parts shifting in test prints. made a few ‚Äúlock‚Äù parts for the wing so it doesn‚Äôt wobble. tested tolerances. fit is tight now, maybe too tight.  
**Time Spent: 2.5 hrs**  
<!-- Use: Wing L Lock.step -->

---

## June 8 - weight balance is wild  
checked weight distro with batteries, camera, vtx. realized the nose was way too light. redesigned battery tray, and shifted components around digitally. will prob need nose weight.  
**Time Spent: 4 hrs**

## June 10 - fuselage fixed (kinda)  
revisited the body design, fused parts into one file then broke them again. made smoother joints between sections. added some basic airflow channels too. not final but better.  
**Time Spent: 3.5 hrs**

## June 11 - stabilizers be stabilizing  
made the vertical and horizontal stabs. kept them modular so i can swap later if needed. added extra wall thickness to survive landings.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**

## June 13 - step files and step backs  
converted everything to .step files. some files got weird scaling bugs. redid fuselage 2 and 4. double-checked sizes, added a master checklist doc.  
**Time Spent: 4 hrs**  
<!-- Use: Fuselage 2.step -->

---

## June 14 - elevator drama  
was working on elevator links and realized i messed up the angle. had to rotate the whole geometry, again. added left and right elevator arms. checked servo slot fit.  
**Time Spent: 2.5 hrs**

---

## June 16 - assembling chaos begins  
did a dry fit with 3D-printed parts. got alignment mostly right. the tail was kinda crooked so i sanded and fixed it. hot glue everywhere.  
**Time Spent: 4 hrs**  
<!-- Use: Wing L 4.step -->

---

## June 17 - motor mounts 101  
spent the whole session on mounting motors. made L and R mounts in Fusion. added 4 mounting holes. tried placing them in nacelles but spacing is tricky.  
**Time Spent: 2.5 hrs**

---

## June 18 - nacelle nerding  
finalized nacelle shapes, made sure they fit the motors without blocking airflow. added a few slits on the side for ventilation. test printed one, came out smooth.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**  
<!-- Use: Nacelle L.step -->

---

## June 20 - component test time  
connected motor, esc, receiver on a test bench. got signal and throttle working. checked rudder movement. stuff‚Äôs reacting fine. esc calibration took forever tho.  
**Time Spent: 2 hrs**

## June 22 - wiring pain  
measured out how to route wires through the body. space is tight. had to change hole diameters and internal tunnels. ran mock wires to see if it fits.  
**Time Spent: 3 hrs**

## June 23 - cg checks and vibes  
balanced the whole model in CAD and on foam stand. cg was off again so i shifted battery and camera slots. model kinda looks good now. getting close.  
**Time Spent: 3.5 hrs**

**next up: flight test prep, maybe foam padding inside, and actual maiden flight**  
this plane‚Äôs gonna glide, even if it nose-dives first try
