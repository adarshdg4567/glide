## what's this  

**Glide** is a twin-motor, tail-boom FPV plane made for cruising skies, catching footage, and flexing at your local field.  
Built for modularity, it’s designed with stability, visibility, and DIY-friendliness in mind.

This 110cm wingspan fixed-wing platform is perfect for long-range missions or just low-pass flybys. Built light with strong parts, and heavy on the style.

She’s front-heavy by design — needs around 300g of battery + FPV gear in the nose to balance right.  
So keep your tail as light as possible unless you want to fight the trim gods.
